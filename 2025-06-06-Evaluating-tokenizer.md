# Beyond Text Compression: Evaluating Tokenizers Across Scales

## Abstract
The paper proposes a cost-effective method for evaluating tokenizers by showing that **smaller 350M models can accurately predict tokenizer performance in larger 2.7B models** - but only for multilingual tasks, not English-only tasks.

## Main Finding
**Tokenizer choice can matter more than model size**: A 350M model with the right tokenizer outperformed a 2.7B model with the wrong tokenizer on multilingual tasks, reducing training costs by 85%.

## Key Discoveries

### Scale Consistency (The Core Breakthrough)
- **Multilingual tasks**: 350M models reliably predict 2.7B performance (correlation = 0.87)
- **English tasks**: 350M models cannot predict 2.7B performance
- **Practical impact**: Can evaluate tokenizers cheaply before expensive large-scale training

### When Tokenizer Choice Matters
- **English tasks**: Tokenizer choice has negligible impact (all work similarly)
- **Multilingual tasks**: Tokenizer choice produces significant, consistent performance differences
- **Translation tasks**: Show the largest tokenizer impact across model scales

## Tokenizers Evaluated
**English-centric:**
- PHI-3-MINI (used by Llama, Mistral, Phi-3)
- GPT-2 (used by GPT-2/3, Megatron, RoBERTa)
- GPT-NeoX (used by GPT-NeoX, DCLM, OLMo)
- Falcon

**Multilingual:**
- Tiktoken (used by GPT-4, Llama 3)
- Aya 23 (23 languages)

## New Evaluation Metrics
**Beyond text compression**, the paper introduces Zipf's law-based metrics that better predict multilingual performance:

1. **CARDINALITY**: Number of unique tokens
2. **AUC**: Area under frequency-rank curve
3. **SLOPE**: Zipfian distribution slope
4. **POWER LAW**: Deviation from Zipfian pattern ⭐ *Best single predictor*

**Key insight**: Tokenizers that produce token distributions aligned with natural language patterns (Zipfian) perform better on multilingual tasks.

## Practical Framework
**Two-stage prediction system:**
1. **Pairwise comparison**: Compare tokenizers using intrinsic metrics
2. **Global ranking**: Aggregate into overall tokenizer rankings

Successfully predicted tokenizer performance across Czech, German, Russian, and Chinese with 73-87% correlation.

## Results Summary
- **Multiple-choice benchmarks**: No clear winner, minimal tokenizer impact
- **English summarization**: Similar performance across tokenizers (except Tiktoken underperformed)
- **Machine translation**: AYA 23 consistently best, significant tokenizer differences

## Practical Implications
1. **Cost savings**: Evaluate tokenizers at 350M scale instead of 2.7B+ (85% cost reduction)
2. **Multilingual focus**: Tokenizer choice critical for non-English applications
3. **Design guidance**: Prioritize Zipfian alignment over compression for multilingual use
4. **Smart selection**: Right tokenizer can compensate for smaller model size

## Limitations
- Limited to decoder-only models ≤2.7B parameters
- Only 5 languages tested (3 scripts)
- May not apply to specialized domains or larger scales
- No multiple random seeds tested

## Bottom Line
**For multilingual AI**: Invest in proper tokenizer selection - it can be more impactful than increasing model size, and you can evaluate this efficiently using smaller models.

**For English-only AI**: Tokenizer choice matters less; focus on other architectural decisions.
